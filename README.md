# StackLight


This project involved designing an algorithm for PowerMetric to overcome a stacklight color detection issue caused by refraction from transparent boxes, which traditional classification models couldn't handle. My solution improved detection accuracy, leading to high client satisfaction.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Electron (for building a cross-platform application)
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Mask RCNN** (for training the model and detecting objects)
  - **OpenCV** (for image processing and feature extraction)
  - **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
  - **Flask** (for API development and integration)
